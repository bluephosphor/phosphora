My main Game Maker project! I've been working on this on and off for a few years now when I have the time. Some key technical features I've built for this include.

#### Procedural level generation

- Several level generation algorithms were written for use in various areas, including Drunken Walk, Cellular Automata, and even a custom Maze generator using an iterative Depth-First-Search algorithm.

#### State Machines and Enemy AI

- Both the player and all mobile entities operate on a custom state machine. 

- Utilizing state concepts, the player is able to have complex behaviors with no interferance between states. The player can run, spin attack, be in hitstun, and also swim.

- Enemies can have passive, aggro and other states. Often times, sub states will be used to create even more complex behaviors (different attack patterns, blocking, ect.).
